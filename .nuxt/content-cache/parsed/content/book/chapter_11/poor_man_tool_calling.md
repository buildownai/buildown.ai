You’ll start by setting up a simple web server with an endpoint to receive user queries and send them to a language model for processing. The goal is to generate function parameters from these queries and then call specific functions based on those parameters."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You'll begin by creating the initial setup of your web server, including a basic UI where users can input their questions. When a query is submitted, it's sent to an AI model that generates JSON responses containing the necessary parameters for your application’s functions. These parameters are used to invoke different functions within your codebase, which then process the data and return results back to the user."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The chapter guides you through each step of this process, from setting up the server endpoint to calling out to a language model and handling function calls based on the generated parameters.
