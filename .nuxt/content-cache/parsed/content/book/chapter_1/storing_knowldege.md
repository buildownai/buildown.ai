We start by exploring the rich history of full-text search techniques that laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated AI systems. From reducing words to their root forms (word stemming) to filtering out common words (stop word removal), these early methods set the stage for more advanced approaches."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Next, we'll uncover the revolutionary concept behind large language models. You'll learn how assigning numbers to words simplifies complex tasks like translation and enables machines to grasp subtle nuances in language. We'll illustrate this with simple examples, showing how numerical representations can capture relationships between singular and plural forms of words, as well as distinctions between domesticated and wild animals."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of word vectoringâ€”a technique that allows large language models to store and interpret vast amounts of textual data efficiently.
