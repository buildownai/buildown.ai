Through an engaging example involving chairs, tables, and horses, we illustrate how different individuals might interpret the same question differently due to their unique perspectives and experiences. This sets the stage for understanding how LLMs process information and generate responses."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Next, we explore the behavior of ants as they navigate through paths marked by pheromones. By assigning weights to these paths based on efficiency and safety, ants demonstrate a natural form of decision-making that mirrors the way LLMs evaluate data and make choices."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The chapter then delves into the human brain's intricate network of neurons and synapses.
