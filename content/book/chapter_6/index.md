# OpenAI Compatible API

In this chapter, you'll discover the benefits of switching your project from using Ollama’s API to a more versatile OpenAI-compatible API. This change will not only future-proof your application but also allow for greater flexibility and compatibility with various third-party tools.

We’ll guide you through updating your codebase to use the official `openai` JavaScript library, which offers improved TypeScript type support and simplifies maintenance. You'll learn how to modify functions like `createEmbeddings`, ensuring they work seamlessly with the new API while keeping your existing logic intact.

Additionally, we'll walk you through migrating your chat endpoint from using native fetch calls to leveraging the OpenAI client for a cleaner and more robust implementation. By following this chapter, you’ll be able to enhance your project’s capabilities and adaptability effortlessly. Dive in and see how easy it is to make these changes!
