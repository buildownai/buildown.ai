# Artificial Brain

In this chapter, we delve into how large language models (LLMs) mirror the intricate workings of the human brain. We'll uncover the parallels between biological neurons and artificial neural networks, illustrating how LLMs process information in a way that's both fascinating and intuitive.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Neural Networks:** Learn about the structure of artificial neural networks, including input layers, hidden layers, and output layers.
- **Forward Propagation & Backpropagation:** Understand how data flows through these layers during training and prediction phases.
- **Activation Functions:** Discover the role of activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh in introducing non-linearity to the network.
- **Transformers & Self-Attention:** Dive into modern architectures that enable LLMs to understand context across long sequences.

Join us as we unravel the mysteries behind these powerful AI systems and see how they're revolutionizing natural language processing. Ready to dive deeper? Let's go!
