# Tokenization

In this chapter, you'll dive into the fascinating world of text processing in AI and large language models. You’ll learn about tokens—those mysterious units that are crucial for understanding how these models work under the hood.

## A More Detailed Look

Here, we explore how natural language is transformed into numerical representations through tokenization. We break down sentences into smaller pieces called tokens, which are then converted into word vectors or embeddings. This process is essential for feeding text data into AI models efficiently and effectively.

## What You Need to Know

### Token Count
Discover why predicting the exact number of tokens in a piece of text can be tricky due to the complex relationship between human language and tokenization algorithms.

### Word Vector Encoders
Get familiar with various word vector encoders, each offering unique advantages. Understand that mixing vectors from different encoders isn’t straightforward because their meanings differ despite similar sizes.

### Terminology
Navigate through common terms like tokens, vectors, embeddings, and more. We’ll help you clarify these concepts to avoid confusion when working with AI APIs.

## More on Word Embedding

Explore the broader landscape of word vectoring and tokenizers. While we cover enough for practical application in this book, there’s a wealth of resources available if you want to dive deeper into advanced topics like BERT, Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.
