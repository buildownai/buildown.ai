In this chapter, you'll discover valuable insights to enhance your AI application development journey. We dive into the art of crafting effective prompts, understanding how models behave under different conditions, and identifying their limitations.

## Prompts

Learn how to create concise and clear instructions for language models. Discover tips on structuring prompts, avoiding negations, and using larger models to generate better prompts. Understand that creating good prompts is a skill that requires practice and patience.

## Don't Fight Against the Model

Instead of battling with model behavior, learn how to work with it by providing more context or adjusting your approach. Choose the right model for specific tasks and understand when verbose explanations are beneficial versus when they might be unnecessary.

## Find the Limits

Explore strategies for identifying a model's limitations and edge cases. Use smaller versions of models to quickly find their limits and understand why certain behaviors occur. Consider user expectations and potential misuse in your application design.
