By setting these prompts, you can make your AI behave exactly how you want it to—whether it’s responding with humor, acting as a strict teacher, or providing detailed explanations.

We’ll walk through examples of how different system prompts change the way an AI interacts with users and provide tips on experimenting with various instructions to find the perfect fit for your application. Plus, we'll show you how to combine informative context with behavior guidelines to create an AI that not only knows what it's talking about but also communicates in a way that’s helpful and engaging.
