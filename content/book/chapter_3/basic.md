Welcome to the chapter where you'll dive into building your first AI-powered web application! In this part, we’ll set up a simple yet powerful environment using **Bun** as our runtime and package manager, and **Hono** as our lightweight web framework. We will also introduce **Ollama**, a tool that allows us to run pre-trained language models locally.

You'll start by initializing your project with a basic Hono application and then extend it to serve an AI model. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a fully functional chat interface where users can interact with a language model in real-time. This setup will give you hands-on experience with integrating machine learning models into web applications.
