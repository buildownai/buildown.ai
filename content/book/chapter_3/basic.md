Welcome to the chapter where you'll dive into building your very own AI-powered web app! In this part of our journey, we're going to set up a basic application using some cool tools like Bun and Hono. These tools will help us create a lightweight yet powerful web framework for our project.

We’ll also be working with Ollama, which is super handy for running pre-trained language models on your local machine. This means you can have an AI assistant right at your fingertips!

First up, we'll initialize the code repository and set up a simple Hono application that greets visitors with "Hello Hono!" Then, we’ll serve our chosen language model using Ollama. Once everything is running smoothly, we’ll extend our app to include a chat interface where users can interact directly with the AI.

By following along, you'll learn how to:

- Create and run a basic web application.
- Serve a pre-trained language model locally.
- Integrate your application with an AI model to generate responses based on user input.
