Welcome to the exciting world of building your very own AI application! In this chapter, you'll dive into writing your first program. We're going to keep things simple and straightforward by focusing on answering questions about a specific backend framework called PURISTA.

Don't worry if you haven’t written much code before; we’ll start with the basics and gradually add more features as we go along. Our goal is to create an application that can respond intelligently to queries, but for now, we won't be concerned with fancy user interfaces. Instead, we'll concentrate on making sure our program works correctly.

To make things even clearer, we're going to use plain old TypeScript and call the API directly from our code without any additional libraries or frameworks. This approach will help you understand how everything fits together under the hood. So roll up your sleeves and get ready to write some code!
