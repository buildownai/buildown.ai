In this chapter, you'll dive into making your AI agent smarter and more efficient. We’ll explore how to store important information like the project description in a separate state variable instead of mixing it with conversation history. This approach keeps things tidy and makes it easier for your AI to understand what’s going on at any given moment.

However, this method also comes with some challenges such as increased complexity and higher costs due to more interactions with large language models (LLMs). We’ll discuss these trade-offs and look at ways to make our system more robust. You'll learn how to improve the conversation flow so that your AI can ask relevant follow-up questions based on user input, making the interaction feel more natural and helpful.
