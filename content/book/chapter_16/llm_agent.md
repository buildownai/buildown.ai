Welcome to the chapter where you'll build your very first AI agent! In this part, we're going to dive into creating an application that guides users through generating detailed project descriptions. This task is perfect for beginners because it's complex enough to be interesting but not so overwhelming that you get lost in the details.

We'll start by setting up our core environment using Hono and Server-Sent Events (SSE) to handle real-time updates smoothly. Our frontend will be built with JSX, making it easy to manage and update as we go along. We’ll also explore how to structure your code into smaller, more manageable functions for better readability.

Next, you'll learn about routing user requests through a smart AI router that decides whether the user is engaging in small talk or providing project information. This involves sending prompts to an AI model to determine the best course of action based on recent messages and context.

By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to build interactive applications with AI agents, setting you up for more advanced projects down the line. Ready to get started? Let's dive in!
