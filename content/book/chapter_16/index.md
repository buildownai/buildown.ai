Welcome to the chapter on **Agents**, where we dive into one of the most exciting areas of artificial intelligence. In this part, you'll discover what an agent truly is in the context of software development and how it differs from theoretical definitions. We’ll provide a practical definition that focuses on an agent's state and purpose, making it easier to understand and implement.

You'll also learn about the benefits of using agents, such as their ability to operate independently without human intervention. This chapter will show you how breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts can lead to more efficient and maintainable systems.

To bring these concepts to life, we’ll walk through a practical example where we enhance our *Buddy* system by allowing users to create new projects with minimal effort. We'll explore innovative ways to guide the user in generating project descriptions, drawing inspiration from popular AI interfaces like ChatGPT and Claude.

Join us as we unravel the potential of agents and how they can revolutionize your approach to building intelligent systems!
