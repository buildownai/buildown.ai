In this chapter, you will dive into the world of creating a structured workflow for your AI application. Imagine having an intelligent assistant that guides users through defining their projects with precision and clarity. By introducing a *checklist*, we aim to make the process more organized and user-friendly.

You'll start by understanding how to manage a checklist within your application's state, ensuring it evolves dynamically based on user inputs. This involves creating prompts for generating new checklist items and marking existing ones as completed. The goal is to keep the conversation flowing naturally without overwhelming users with unnecessary questions or jumping between unrelated topics.

Next, you will see how to integrate this checklist into your AI’s decision-making process. By updating the checklist status based on user responses, you can ensure that each step of project definition remains relevant and focused. This chapter also covers refining follow-up messages generated by your AI, making them more engaging and informative while adhering strictly to the provided facts.

Finally, you will explore how to extend your application’s capabilities by handling different scenarios where only checklist updates are needed without altering the overall description. This flexibility allows for a smoother user experience as they navigate through defining their projects.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a robust system in place that enhances user interaction and ensures project descriptions are accurate and comprehensive.
