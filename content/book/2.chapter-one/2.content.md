As I delved deeper into the world of chatbots, I realized that my initial expectations were misguided. I was asking basic questions, but the true potential of these models lay beyond simple queries. It took time and experimentation to grasp their capabilities, starting with tasks like translations and text corrections. The "wow" moment came when a bot generated a unit test based on source code, outperforming me in speed and accuracy. This sparked curiosity about how and why it worked so well.

As I explored further, I encountered numerous tools, snippets, packages, and resources, but found that understanding them required a solid foundation of basic knowledge. In this chapter, the author aims to provide a simplified overview of large language models, breaking down complex concepts into easy-to-understand terms. This is essential for developing one's own AI and unlocking its true potential.
