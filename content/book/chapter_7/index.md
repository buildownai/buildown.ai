Welcome back to our journey of building your own AI! In this chapter, we dive into the crucial task of creating a robust dataset that will form the backbone of your AI's intelligence. You'll discover how to transform existing documents like handbook markdown files into valuable data sources for your model.

We start by exploring the question-answer pair approachâ€”a straightforward yet powerful method to structure your dataset. This format not only makes it easy to manage and understand but also serves as a reliable fact store for your chatbot.

Next, we introduce the knowledge-graph approach, which offers a more sophisticated way of handling complex queries. By mapping out relationships between entities in graph form, you can provide richer and more detailed answers. While this method is more challenging to implement, it opens up exciting possibilities for advanced AI capabilities.

Join us as we unravel these techniques and equip yourself with the skills to build an intelligent dataset that will make your AI truly stand out!
