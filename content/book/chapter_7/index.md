Welcome back, fellow developers! In this chapter, we dive into the nitty-gritty of creating high-quality data sets for our AI applications. We'll explore how to transform existing information into useful datasets that can power your AI models.

First up, we tackle the challenge of turning handbook files filled with valuable info into a format that's easy for machines to understand and use. Our goal is to create datasets that are not only accurate but also meaningful for our chatbots.

We start by looking at question-answer pairs as a simple yet powerful way to structure your data. This approach makes it straightforward to manage and human-readable, acting like a fact store for your AI model.

Then, we venture into the world of knowledge graphs. These complex structures can handle intricate relationships between different pieces of information, allowing your chatbot to provide more detailed answers to user queries. While this method is more challenging to implement, it offers significant benefits in terms of flexibility and depth of response.
