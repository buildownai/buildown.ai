In this chapter, we dive into the practical aspects of integrating our question-answer system into a real-world application. We'll explore how to adjust your codebase to incorporate these new features and improve the accuracy of responses by refining embeddings.

You’ll start by modifying an existing application to include routes that utilize FAQ data for comparison with traditional methods. This hands-on approach will help you understand the differences in performance between various implementations.

Next, we tackle the challenge of creating effective embeddings. We discuss whether it's better to use both questions and answers or just the question alone when generating these embeddings. Understanding how embeddings work is crucial here, as they form the backbone of our AI’s ability to match user queries with relevant information.

After refining your embedding strategy, you’ll re-test your application to see if the changes have improved its performance in handling variations in user questions. We'll compare results from different approaches and highlight any discrepancies that arise.

Finally, we look at ways to enhance the quality of responses by tweaking system prompts and including more context within them. This section will guide you through updating your code to provide richer, more informative answers to users.

By following along with this chapter, you’ll gain valuable insights into how to effectively implement AI-driven question-answer systems in practical scenarios. Dive in and see how these techniques can elevate the user experience of your applications!
