In this chapter, you will learn how to take the knowledge gained from creating question-answer pairs and apply it in a real-world scenario. We'll guide you through integrating these pairs into an existing application, making adjustments as necessary for seamless integration.

We start by discussing the importance of refining embeddings when dealing with variations in user questions. You’ll explore two approaches: using both the question and answer to create embeddings or relying solely on the question. Understanding how embeddings work will help you make informed decisions about which approach suits your use case best.

Next, we'll walk through re-testing your implementation after making these adjustments. We provide a comparison table that highlights differences between document chunk versions and question-answer versions of responses. This helps in identifying areas for improvement and ensuring accuracy.

Finally, we delve into enhancing the quality of answers by updating system prompts to better utilize provided context. You’ll see how including both questions and answers in the context can lead to more informative and precise responses from your AI assistant.

By following this chapter, you'll gain practical insights on integrating question-answer pairs into applications and refining them for optimal performance. Dive in to enhance your AI application's capabilities!
