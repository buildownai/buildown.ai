In this chapter, you'll dive into the process of reviewing a manageable set of around 200 question-answer pairs derived from your markdown files. This hands-on activity will help you understand how well the language model has captured and interpreted the original text.

Youâ€™ll explore various examples to see if the generated answers are accurate, informative, and provide enough context. For instance, you might find an answer that is technically correct but lacks depth or additional relevant details. You'll also encounter cases where the model's interpretation may be slightly off, such as when it incorrectly states that a subscription cannot return a value.

Moreover, this chapter highlights the importance of enriching your dataset by adding more context to the answers and considering whether certain question-answer pairs are truly relevant to the framework or if they pertain to other aspects like the handbook itself. This review process is crucial for ensuring the quality and relevance of your data before moving forward with further steps in building your AI.
