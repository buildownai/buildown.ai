In this chapter, you'll discover how to access and utilize the knowledge graph that you've built. We start by diving into retrieving data directly from the database using SQL-like queries to fetch entities and their relationships. Youâ€™ll learn how to extract both incoming and outgoing connections for a given node, painting a comprehensive picture of its place within your system.

Next, we'll explore creating context from this retrieved information. By transforming raw query results into structured text, you can seamlessly integrate these details into the AI's understanding, enhancing its ability to provide accurate responses based on interconnected data points.

Finally, we tackle the challenge of identifying relevant entities and their IDs from user queries. We discuss various strategies for extracting this crucial information, including search mechanisms, extending question-answer pairs with entity references, leveraging language models, and utilizing tool calling techniques. This chapter sets you up to effectively bridge your knowledge graph with conversational AI capabilities.
