In this chapter, you'll dive into the fascinating world of building a knowledge graph. We’ll explore how to represent information as interconnected entities and relationships, which can be incredibly useful for tasks like answering questions or making recommendations.

You'll learn how to use a language model to automatically extract entities from text, storing them as nodes in your graph with unique identifiers, names, and descriptions. Additionally, you'll discover how to capture the relationships between these entities as edges, detailing their types and descriptions.

We’ll walk through the process of extracting entities and relations using a generic approach that can handle various types of entities without needing detailed instructions for each one. You'll also see how to store this information in SurrealDB, taking advantage of its schemaless data modeling capabilities to easily manage nodes (entities) and edges (relationships).

By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to build a knowledge graph that provides context and enhances the language model's ability to answer questions accurately. Dive in and see how powerful these graphs can be!
