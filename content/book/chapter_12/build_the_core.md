In this chapter, you'll dive into the heart of building your own AI application. We start by setting up a monorepo project and focus on developing a chat pane that uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication between the frontend and backend.

You’ll explore how to leverage existing component templates with Tailwind CSS to speed up frontend development, and learn about integrating SSE in your Vue components. We'll also cover using markdown-it for Markdown formatting and highlight.js for syntax highlighting within our chat pane.

On the backend side, you'll work with Hono and Zod OpenAPI Hono to create robust API endpoints that support conversational AI interactions via SSE. You’ll see how to handle project management, including cloning Git repositories and managing database entries for each project.

Additionally, we’ll touch on implementing basic access control using JWT tokens, ensuring your application has the necessary security features without overcomplicating things. This chapter aims to give you hands-on experience with key components needed for building a real-world AI-driven application.
