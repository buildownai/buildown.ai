Welcome to the chapter on Code Generation! Here, you'll discover how to leverage powerful AI models to create useful code snippets for your projects. We’ll explore a detailed system prompt that guides an AI assistant named Buddy in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses based on project files.

You will also learn about integrating these generated snippets into your development environment seamlessly. This includes handling various scenarios such as applying changes when the file doesn’t exist, is open but unsaved, or exists elsewhere within your editor tabs. We’ll delve into using a global event pub/sub system to facilitate communication between different components of your application.

Moreover, we cover enhancing developer productivity with AI-powered code completion suggestions. You'll see how to implement this feature by tracking cursor positions and leveraging the CodeMirror 6 editor along with its copilot plugin for efficient autocomplete functionality. The backend logic involves generating meaningful completions based on context-aware FiM (Fill in the Middle) techniques.

Join us as we dive into these exciting features and learn how to streamline your development workflow using AI-driven tools!
