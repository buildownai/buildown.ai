Welcome to the chapter on building file system tools for your AI! In this part, you'll discover how to equip your AI with the ability to navigate through folders and files within a codebase. We’ll cover creating tools that can retrieve the directory structure, read file contents, and even check if a file exists.

You'll start by crafting a tool that lets your AI explore directories and list their contents in a user-friendly way. This includes filtering out unnecessary files like binary data or hidden system folders to keep things clean and focused on what's important.

Next up is reading the content of specific files, which is crucial for answering questions accurately based on the codebase. You'll learn how to format this information neatly so that it’s easy for your AI to understand and present back to users.

While writing functions might seem like a good idea at first, you’ll see why directly manipulating files through an AI can lead to unintended consequences. Instead of implementing these risky features, we’ll explore ways to enhance user control over file operations in a safer manner.

Lastly, you'll find out how checking for the existence of files can be integrated into your existing read file tool, making it more versatile and reliable.

Join me as we dive deeper into each section and build powerful tools that make interacting with code repositories through an AI both efficient and enjoyable.
