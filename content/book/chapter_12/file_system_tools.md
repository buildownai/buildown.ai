In this chapter, you'll dive into the world of building practical tools that help an AI interact with a codebase. Imagine your AI being able to navigate through files and folders like a pro! We’ll start by creating a tool that lets your AI explore the file structure, including subfolders, while ignoring unnecessary files such as binary images or hidden configuration files.

Next up, we'll tackle reading file content. This is crucial for answering questions accurately based on what's inside those files. You'll learn how to return file contents in a way that’s easy for the AI to understand and use effectively.

Then, you’ll explore writing functions, but with a twist! We’ll discuss why directly creating or modifying files might not be such a great idea after all. Instead, we’ll shift towards giving users more control over their code changes, making your AI application feel more like an integrated development environment (IDE).

Lastly, we'll look at checking if a file exists before trying to read it. This ensures that the AI always has the most up-to-date information and avoids unnecessary errors.
