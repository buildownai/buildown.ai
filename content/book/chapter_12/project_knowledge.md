Welcome to the chapter on Project Knowledge! Here, you'll discover how to equip your AI with a comprehensive understanding of projects and their files. We’ll cover two main areas: General Knowledge about the project as a whole, and Per-File Knowledge for detailed insights.

In the first section, we dive into gathering basic information such as the programming language used, overall structure, framework details, and more. This foundational knowledge helps your AI understand the context of each project it interacts with. We’ll explore how to extract this data from file structures and package.json files, ensuring your AI has a solid base for interaction.

The second part focuses on Per-File Knowledge, where we delve into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. You'll learn about two methods: Chunk & Embed and AST & Embed, as well as an alternative approach that leverages large language models to generate summaries of individual files. This method is more flexible but resource-intensive.

By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to enhance your AI’s capabilities by providing it with detailed project knowledge, making interactions smoother and more effective for users. Dive in and see how these techniques can elevate your AI's performance!
