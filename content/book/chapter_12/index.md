Welcome to the exciting world of building your very own AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE)! In this chapter, you'll dive into creating a proof-of-concept application called **Buddy**. This IDE will feature an interactive chat pane where you can converse with an AI about your project or repository, and it will also include advanced features like code autocompletion and syntax highlighting for various programming languages.

Youâ€™ll be using a range of cutting-edge technologies such as Bun, Biome, SurrealDB, Hono, Vue, Tailwind CSS, Ollama, Qwen 2.5 14b, and the OpenAI Client Library to bring your IDE to life. The project structure is organized into two main packages: `packages/frontend` for the user interface and `packages/backend` for server-side logic.

By following this guide, you'll not only learn how to set up and run your AI IDE but also gain valuable insights into integrating different tools and frameworks effectively. So roll up your sleeves and get ready to build something truly innovative!
