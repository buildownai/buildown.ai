Welcome to the exciting world of building an AI-driven Integrated Development Environment (IDE)! In this chapter, you'll embark on a journey to create **Buddy**, your very own proof-of-concept IDE that integrates seamlessly with AI capabilities. Imagine having a chatbot right within your code editor, ready to assist you in navigating files, writing custom snippets, and even providing intelligent autocompletion.

We’ll dive into the technical aspects of setting up an environment using modern tools like Bun for runtime management, Biome for linting and formatting, and SurrealDB as our database. On the frontend side, we'll use Vue to build a clean and structured interface with Tailwind CSS for styling. Our AI backend will be powered by Ollama and the Qwen 2.5 14b model.

This chapter is not just about coding; it's about understanding how different technologies can come together to create something innovative and useful. Whether you're familiar with Vue or new to frontend frameworks, this project will guide you through each step of development, from cloning the repository to running your own AI-powered IDE locally.

Ready to dive in? Let’s build Buddy and explore the future of coding!
