# Gimmicks

In this chapter, you'll dive into the playful side of AI development. We break free from typical constraints and focus on experimenting with interesting models and features that can enhance your chatbot's capabilities.

## Accessing Webpages

Discover how to convert web pages into Markdown text using a model called Reader LM. This conversion allows your chatbot to handle URLs more effectively, fetching content directly and presenting it in an easily readable format. Learn the nuances of integrating external tools and overriding default behaviors within AI models to make this happen.

## NPM Package Information

Enhance your chatbot's utility by enabling it to provide information about NPM packages, such as checking if a specific package is up-to-date. You'll explore how to fetch data from NPM APIs and process JSON responses efficiently before passing them to the language model for insightful answers. Dive into techniques that optimize performance and ensure smooth interactions with your users.
