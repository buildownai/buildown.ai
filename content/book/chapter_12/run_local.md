Welcome to the chapter where you'll learn how to get *Buddy* running smoothly on your own computer! This section is all about setting up a local environment for testing and experimenting with *Buddy*. You’ll start by installing necessary tools like [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and Docker, then clone the repository from GitHub. After that, you'll install dependencies and pull required models using Ollama.

Once your setup is complete, you'll learn how to start the database and run *Buddy* itself. You’ll also discover how to log in and manage projects, including adding new ones by providing a Git repository URL. The indexing process will be explained, along with tips on monitoring progress through Surrealist.

Finally, we dive into configuration options for customizing your local environment, covering everything from server settings to database connections and AI model configurations. This chapter is packed with practical steps that make it easy to get started with *Buddy* right away!
