In this chapter, you'll dive into the world of reasoning prompts. These are powerful tools that help an AI clearly articulate the rationale behind its suggestions or decisions. You’ll explore how to craft these prompts effectively so that the AI can explain not only what it does but also why it does it.

You'll see examples of reasoning prompts in action, such as guiding the AI to justify optimization choices for a function or explaining financial decisions with potential risks and rewards. These examples will illustrate how reasoning prompts provide deeper insights into complex topics by answering 'why' questions rather than just 'how' or 'what'.

The chapter also delves into the differences between explanation and reasoning prompts, highlighting their unique roles in enhancing understanding and decision-making processes.

Additionally, you'll discover the benefits of using reasoning prompts, such as building trust through transparency and aiding AI developers in refining model behavior. You’ll learn when to use these prompts effectively, especially in fields like finance, engineering, or product design where clear rationale is crucial for informed decisions.
