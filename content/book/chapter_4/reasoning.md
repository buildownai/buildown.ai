In this chapter, you'll dive into the world of reasoning prompts. These are special instructions that help an AI explain its thought process when making decisions or giving advice. Imagine asking your AI assistant why it suggested a particular action; with reasoning prompts, you get clear explanations about the logic behind each recommendation.

Youâ€™ll explore various examples where reasoning prompts shine, such as optimizing functions, financial planning, and improving design choices. Each example will show how to ask for detailed justifications that help users understand both benefits and potential risks.

The chapter also highlights the difference between explanation and reasoning prompts. While explanations focus on breaking down topics step-by-step, reasoning prompts delve into why certain decisions are made. This distinction is crucial for building trust in AI recommendations.

Discover the many benefits of using reasoning prompts, especially in fields like finance, engineering, or product design where understanding the rationale is key to making informed choices. Plus, learn when and how to use these prompts effectively to enhance transparency and clarity in your interactions with AI systems.
