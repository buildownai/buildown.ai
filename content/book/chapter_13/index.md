In this chapter, we take a moment to reflect on what we've learned in building the *Buddy* application. We'll recap key insights such as selecting the right model parameters and understanding the nuances of tool calling and instruction crafting for language models.

We also dive into new topics like managing chat conversation history effectively. You’ll learn why it’s crucial to handle large context sizes wisely, avoiding issues with memory limitations and ensuring clear communication between users and AI systems.

Additionally, we explore the world of frameworks designed specifically for working with language models. We discuss why starting with direct API usage is beneficial before diving into more complex frameworks. This chapter will give you a solid foundation to choose the right framework based on your specific needs and use cases. 

Join us as we continue our journey towards mastering AI development!
