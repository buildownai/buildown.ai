In this chapter, you'll dive into a whirlwind tour of some of the most popular frameworks for building language model applications. We won't get too deep into the nitty-gritty details here; instead, weâ€™ll give you an overview of what each framework does and when it might be useful to use them.

You'll learn about three main frameworks: LangChain, LangGraph, and LlamaIndex, all available in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript. We'll also touch on the Transformers library for those who want to work more closely with models themselves.

Each framework has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, LangChain offers a lot of abstraction but might be too complex for simpler tasks. On the other hand, LlamaIndex is great for beginners due to its low learning curve and focus on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a better understanding of which framework suits your project best. So grab a cup of coffee and let's explore these exciting tools together!
