Welcome to the Model Zoo chapter! Here, you'll discover a vast collection of AI models that can be used for various purposes. We’ll guide you through different platforms like Hugging Face, Ollama, and LM Studio where these models are available.

You will learn about model families—groups of models with similar architecture but varying sizes and capabilities. Understanding the naming conventions and versioning helps in choosing the right model for your needs. For instance, the Llama family from Meta offers different versions like 1B, 3B, 11B, and more.

We’ll also cover key concepts such as parameter count and quantization, which affect a model’s performance and resource requirements. Smaller models are often derived from larger ones through distillation, making them efficient but potentially less capable for certain tasks.

Additionally, you'll explore the capabilities of different model families, ranging from text generation to image processing. We’ll highlight popular model families like Llama, Qwen, Mistral, Phi, and Gemma, along with their unique features and use cases.

Lastly, we delve into GGUF and MLX formats—essential for deploying models in production environments. These formats optimize performance on specific hardware while balancing efficiency and accuracy trade-offs through quantization techniques.
