Welcome to the Model Zoo chapter! Here, you'll dive into a vast collection of pre-trained AI models that can be used for various applications. We’ll guide you through different platforms like Hugging Face, LM Studio, and Ollama where these models are hosted.

You will learn about model families—groups of models with similar architecture but varying sizes and capabilities. Understanding the naming conventions and versioning helps in selecting the right model for your project. For instance, knowing that a larger model might offer more advanced features while consuming more resources can help you make informed decisions.

We’ll also introduce you to key concepts like quantization, which reduces the size of models by converting numeric values into simpler formats, making them easier to deploy on devices with limited computational power. However, this process may come at the cost of reduced accuracy and precision.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to navigate through different model families, understand their capabilities, and choose the best fit for your AI projects. Whether you're building a chatbot or working on complex text generation tasks, this guide will help you find the perfect model to get started!
