In this chapter, you'll dive into refining your AI's knowledgebase to ensure it delivers accurate and relevant answers. We start by addressing the issues in our current approach, such as incorrect data usage and embedding methods. Youâ€™ll learn how to correct these mistakes by following a systematic process of identifying problems and implementing fixes.

Next, we focus on improving embeddings by adhering to best practices outlined in documentation. This involves modifying your code to include task instructions for both documents and user queries, ensuring the language model understands the context better.

Then, you'll tackle the challenge of merging chunks to create a more coherent and structured context. By grouping related information and including headlines, we make it easier for the AI to provide precise answers.

Finally, we validate these improvements by testing various questions and observing how the quality of responses has changed. We also discuss the limitations of our current dataset and the importance of having a well-structured fact database or FAQ set to further enhance your AI's performance.

Join us as we take your AI application from good to great with these essential refinements!
