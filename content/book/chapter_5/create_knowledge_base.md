Welcome to the chapter where we dive deep into building a solid foundation for our AI project! In this part, you'll learn how to create a comprehensive knowledgebase that holds all the necessary information about PURISTA. We’ll explore the process of selecting an appropriate database system and transforming Markdown documentation into a format that can be efficiently queried.

We start by choosing SurrealDB as our storage solution due to its flexibility and powerful features. You'll discover why this database stands out, especially with its multimodel approach which supports document, graph, and relational data models. We’ll also cover how to set up SurrealDB locally using Docker for easy access and management.

Next, we tackle the challenge of transforming our Markdown handbook into a searchable format within SurrealDB. Traditional full-text search methods have their limitations, so we introduce vector search as an advanced technique to find semantically similar documents. This method uses embeddings to enhance the relevance of search results, making it perfect for AI projects.

Join us on this journey and see how building a robust knowledgebase can elevate your project's capabilities!
