Welcome to the exciting world of RAG, where we'll dive into a method that significantly boosts your AI's ability to provide accurate and relevant answers. In this chapter, youâ€™ll discover how to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that allows your AI to access external knowledge sources in real-time.

Imagine asking your AI about a specific topic, but instead of relying solely on its pre-trained data, it can pull in the latest information from structured databases or APIs. This chapter will guide you through creating and managing these knowledge sources, identifying which pieces of information are crucial for answering user queries, fetching that information efficiently, and finally generating responses based on this enriched context.

By mastering RAG, you'll ensure your AI stays up-to-date with the most recent facts and figures, making it a reliable source of information in various domains. Get ready to take your AI applications to the next level by integrating dynamic knowledge retrieval!
