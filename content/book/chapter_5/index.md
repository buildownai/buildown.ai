Welcome to the exciting world of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)! In this chapter, you'll discover how to make your AI smarter by giving it access to real-time information. Imagine asking your AI a question and having it pull in just the right facts from external databases or files to give you an accurate answer. No more generic responses; RAG ensures that your AI can provide precise, up-to-date answers every time.

You'll dive into creating knowledge sources, identifying what specific data is needed for each query, fetching this information efficiently, and then generating a response based on the enriched context. By mastering RAG, you'll unlock the full potential of your AI to handle complex queries with ease. Ready to take your AI's capabilities to the next level? Letâ€™s get started!
