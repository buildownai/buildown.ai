In this chapter, you will learn the importance of evaluating and refining answers produced by your AI system. We'll start by breaking down an example answer to assess its correctness and relevancy. Then, we’ll define clear expectations for what a good response should look like before diving into improving our RAG-based model's performance.

You'll discover how adjusting the system prompt can significantly enhance the quality of generated answers. Through practical examples and test queries, you will understand why consistency and accuracy are crucial when dealing with complex frameworks such as PURISTA. By following these steps, you’ll be able to create more reliable and user-friendly AI chat agents that provide precise information tailored to specific needs.
