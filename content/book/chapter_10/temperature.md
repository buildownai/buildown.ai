Welcome to the chapter on **Model Temperature**! Here, you'll dive into understanding a crucial aspect of fine-tuning your AI applications: how adjusting the model's temperature can help manage common issues like hallucinations and repetitions. You’ll learn why these problems occur and discover practical tips for balancing creativity with accuracy in your models' output.

In this chapter, we explore:

- **Hallucination**: Discover what happens when your language model starts inventing facts or quoting non-existent research papers.
  
- **Repetition**: Learn about the frustrating cycle of repetitive text that can emerge from overfitting to certain phrases.

- **Temperature Control**: Understand how tweaking the temperature parameter between 0 and 1 influences the randomness versus determinism in your AI's output. 

We'll also cover:

- The math behind temperature (don't worry, it’s explained simply!).
  
- How different temperatures affect precision and creativity.
  
- Tips for handling unexpected JSON responses when using higher temperatures.

Finally, we provide advice on how to tackle these issues effectively, including the importance of choosing larger models if you encounter persistent problems. Ready to make your AI applications more reliable? Dive in and find out!
