Welcome to the chapter on **Model Temperature**! Here, you'll dive into understanding how a single tweak can dramatically change your AI's behavior. Discover why and when to adjust this crucial parameter to balance between creativity and accuracy in your model’s output.

You’ll explore two common challenges faced by developers: hallucination (where the model invents facts) and repetition (when it regurgitates similar phrases). We'll explain how adjusting the temperature can mitigate these issues, making your AI more reliable for tasks ranging from creative writing to precise data extraction. 

Get ready to learn about the mathematical underpinnings of temperature in a way that’s easy to grasp, and find out why smaller models might need different handling compared to their larger counterparts. Plus, we’ll share practical tips on when it's best to stick with defaults versus making adjustments.
