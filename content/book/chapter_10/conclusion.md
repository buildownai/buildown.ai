In this final chapter, we wrap up our journey by summarizing the key findings from our extensive testing. You'll discover how larger models excel at extracting knowledge but are also more prone to issues like hallucinations and providing excessive information. We delve into the performance of specific models such as *Llama 3.2 3B* and *Llama 3.1 8B*, highlighting their strengths and limitations in generating quick responses, data extraction, and building knowledge graphs.

We also discuss the importance of refining system prompts to enhance model performance and address challenges like context creation. The chapter concludes with a reflection on the decision-making process behind choosing between models like Llama and Qwen Coder based on user preferences for concise answers and collaborative interaction. Join us as we draw insightful conclusions from our tests and explore the nuances of selecting the right AI model for your needs.
