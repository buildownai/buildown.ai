Welcome back, intrepid AI builder! In this chapter, we dive into some exciting ways to take your AI project to the next level. We'll look at how you can split the process of generating question-answer pairs and graph data to achieve better results.

First up, we’ll explore splitting the generation of questions and answers into separate steps. This allows for more creative questions while ensuring that the answers remain accurate and contextually relevant. By using different temperature settings for each step, you'll gain greater control over the output quality.

Next, we’ll discuss how to use multiple models in your workflow. Imagine harnessing a creative language model for crafting intriguing questions and a precise fact-based model for delivering spot-on answers. This approach can lead to richer and more varied outcomes but requires careful handling of duplicates or similar results.

We'll also cover splitting the graph generation process into distinct stages, such as entity extraction, cleaning up entities, and building relationships between them. This method gives you finer control over data quality and helps prevent errors like creating links with non-existent entities.

Lastly, we’ll delve into using graph relations more effectively by filtering out irrelevant connections based on context or relationship type. By asking specific queries about the dependencies and interactions between entities, you can generate highly relevant responses that capture complex relationships in a clear and concise manner.
