In this chapter, we embark on a journey to assess and improve our application's performance. We'll dive into understanding why the `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` model might not be the best fit for certain tasks like data extraction and RAG data generation. By examining key properties such as context size, parameter count, and quantization level, we will uncover how these factors influence our model's capabilities. Get ready to learn how to choose a more suitable AI model that can handle larger datasets with greater precision and efficiency!
