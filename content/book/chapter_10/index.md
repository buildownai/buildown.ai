In this chapter, we dive into evaluating the performance of our existing AI model. We'll take a closer look at the `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` model and assess its capabilities based on key metrics like context size, parameter count, and quantization level. Understanding these factors is crucial for determining if our current model is up to the task or if we need to consider alternatives with better performance in data extraction and RAG data generation. Join us as we explore how to make informed decisions about upgrading our AI application!
