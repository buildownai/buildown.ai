Welcome to the chapter where we dive into the world of datasets! Here, you'll learn how crucial it is to have a reliable and correct dataset for your AI applications. We will explore how larger models like **Qwen 2.5** can extract detailed information from data, creating rich knowledge graphs that are essential for building robust AI systems.

In this chapter, we’ll focus on the process of generating datasets using different model sizes (32B and 72B) and temperatures to ensure consistency and reproducibility. We'll also look at how these models create intricate relationships between entities like commands, command builders, and config stores, providing a comprehensive understanding of your AI application's data structure.

By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a clear idea of how to set up your own dataset for testing and development, making sure that every piece of information is accurate and relevant. So, grab your favorite coding snack and let’s dive into the fascinating world of datasets!
