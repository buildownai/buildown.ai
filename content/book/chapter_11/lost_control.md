Welcome to the chapter where we delve into the complexities of controlling AI language models. In this part, you'll discover how these sophisticated tools can sometimes feel like they're running the show instead of us. We'll uncover why it's so tricky to predict their behavior and ensure that they deliver exactly what we want.

We start by examining the root cause behind this loss of control. You’ll learn about the critical role played by system prompts and model configurations, such as size and temperature settings, in shaping how these models respond. Understanding these factors is key to grasping why certain behaviors emerge.

Next, you'll join us on an experimental journey where we test different models under various conditions. We'll look closely at how models like Qwen 2.4 3B and Llama 3.2 3B handle prompts and tool calls, revealing fascinating insights into their decision-making processes.

As we dig deeper, we’ll explore the concept of "Exponential Cascading Inaccuracies," a phenomenon where small inaccuracies in responses can lead to increasingly flawed outcomes over time. This understanding is crucial for anyone working with AI models in real-world applications.

Finally, you'll see how using larger and more capable models like Qwen 2.5 14B can help mitigate these issues while still delivering high-quality results.

Join us as we unravel the mysteries of controlling AI language models and learn valuable lessons that will enhance your ability to work with them effectively.
