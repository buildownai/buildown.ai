Welcome to the chapter on Modern Tool Calling! In this part, you'll discover how to transform your AI application from a rigid, hardcoded system into one that dynamically selects and uses tools based on context. This shift will make your application more flexible and responsive.

You’ll start by understanding why modern tool calling is essential for improving user interactions and performance. We’ll explore the evolution of tool calling, from early manual approaches to today’s sophisticated integration with language models and APIs. 

Next, you'll dive into practical steps for migrating your existing solution. You'll learn how to:

- Skip manual JSON generation.
- Integrate tools directly using libraries like `openai`.
- Adjust response handling to work seamlessly with new tooling.

We’ll walk through defining schemas for tool inputs, creating the actual tool functions, and aligning calls to language models. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a leaner, more efficient application that leverages modern tool calling techniques.

Ready to take your AI application to the next level? Dive in and see how easy it is to migrate to modern tool calling!
