In this chapter, you'll discover the exciting world of modern tool calling in AI applications. Youâ€™ll learn why relying on hardcoded solutions is limiting and how to transition your application to a more dynamic approach.

We start by understanding the evolution of tool calling and its importance in making your AI system smarter and more adaptable. We explore early methods and see how they've transformed into today's sophisticated techniques that integrate seamlessly with various models and providers.

Next, we guide you through the process of migrating your application to modern tool calling. You'll learn how to:

- Skip manual steps for generating parameters.
- Use powerful libraries like `openai` directly in your code.
- Adjust response generation to work smoothly with new tools.

We provide practical examples, such as defining schemas and creating tool functions, to help you understand the implementation details. By following our step-by-step instructions, you'll see how easy it is to enhance your application's capabilities.

Finally, we show you how to test your updated application and troubleshoot common issues that might arise during this transition. This chapter will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to build more flexible and efficient AI applications using modern tool calling techniques.
